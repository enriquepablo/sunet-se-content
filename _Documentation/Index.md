- [Navigation Metadata](_Documentation/Navigation%20Metadata.md): How the metadata that drives the construction of the navigational elements of the site is structured.
- [Content Metadata](_Documentation/Content%20Metadata.md): How to characterize the different types of content items through their metadata.
- [Editing content](_Documentation/Editing%20content.md): An introduction to the UI to edit the markdown content that will compose the site.
- [Publishing Content](_Documentation/Publishing%20Content.md): How to publish changes to staging, how to undo a publication, how to see and discard changes.
